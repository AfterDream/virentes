## reproducible science for virentes introgression study

#### This repository is registered as doi:xxxyyzz

### Directions

This repository contains several IPython notebooks outlining code to completely reproduce 
all analyses in the manuscript "Hybridization both obscures and reveals historical relationships among the American live oaks" (Eaton et al. xxxx). The notebooks can be viewed as 'read-only' by opening the links below, or they can be opened and executed as IPython notebooks.  

### Notebooks  

#### data assembly 
This notebook contains the code to download sequence data and assemble it in pyRAD v. 2.13. The final result is multiple data sets saved in the directory `assembled_datasets`, available in this repository.  
[RAD assembly notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/dereneaton/virentes/blob/master/virentes_introgression.ipynb)  

#### analyses
The assembled data sets are too large to host in this repository, and are instead hosted on `Dryad` at [this repository link to be added soon](linktodryad).  The notebook below use these assembled data sets for analyses.  

This notebook contains the code used for RAxML analyses performed on the data sets in `assembled_datasets`.

This notebook contains the code used for TreeMix analyses performed on the large ingroup SNP data set xxxxxxx.

This notebook contains the code used for D-statistic analyses performed in _pyRAD_ using the largest .loci data set file xxxxxxx.
