### Directions

This repository contains several IPython notebooks outlining code to completely reproduce 
all analyses in the manuscript "Hybridization both obscures and reveals historical relationships among the American live oaks" (Eaton et al. xxxx). The notebooks can be viewed as 'read-only' by opening the links below, or they can be opened and executed as IPython notebooks.  

### Notebooks  
The assembly notebook code contains scripts to download the sequence data and assemble it in pyRAD v. 2.13. The final result is the data sets contained in the directory `assembled_datasets`, available in this repository.
