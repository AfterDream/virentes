## Reproducible science for live oak introgression study

#### This repository is registered as doi:xxxyyzz

### Directions

This repository contains several IPython notebooks with code to completely reproduce 
all analyses in the manuscript "Hybridization both obscures and reveals historical relationships among the American live oaks" (Eaton et al. xxxx). The notebooks can be viewed as 'read-only' by opening the links below, or they can be opened and executed as IPython notebooks.  

### Notebooks  

#### Data assembly 
This notebook contains code to download sequence data and assemble it in pyRAD v. 2.13.  
1. [RAD assembly notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/dereneaton/virentes/blob/master/nb1_virentes_assembly.ipynb)  

#### Assembled data 
The assembled data sets are too large to host here, and are instead available on `Dryad` at [this repository link to be added soon](linktodryad). These data sets are used in the notebooks below. 

#### Analyses  
This notebook contains code used for RAxML analyses.  
2. [Phylogenetic analysis notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/dereneaton/virentes/blob/master/nb2_virentes_trees.ipynb)  

This notebook contains code used for D-statistic analyses performed in _pyRAD_.  
3. [D-statistics introgression analysis notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/dereneaton/virentes/blob/master/nb3_virentes_dtests.ipynb)  

This notebook contains code used for Structure and TreeMix analyses.  
4. [Population analyses notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/dereneaton/virentes/blob/master/nb4_virentes_populations.ipynb)  

This notebook contains code used for fitting demographic models in _dadi__.  
5. [_dadi_ introgression analysis notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/dereneaton/virentes/master/nb5_virentes_dadi.ipynb)
