## Reproducible science for virentes introgression study

#### This repository is registered as doi:xxxyyzz

### Directions

This repository contains several IPython notebooks outlining code to completely reproduce 
all analyses in the manuscript "Hybridization both obscures and reveals historical relationships among the American live oaks" (Eaton et al. xxxx). The notebooks can be viewed as 'read-only' by opening the links below, or they can be opened and executed as IPython notebooks.  

### Notebooks  

#### data assembly 
This notebook contains code to download sequence data and assemble it in pyRAD v. 2.13.  
[RAD assembly notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/dereneaton/virentes/blob/master/virentes_introgression.ipynb)  

#### data set location  
Our assembled data sets are too large to host in this repository, and are instead hosted on `Dryad` at [this repository link to be added soon](linktodryad).  The notebooks below use these assembled data sets for further analyses.  

#### analyses  
This notebook contains code used for RAxML analyses performed across many  data sets.  
[RAxML phylogenetic analysis notebook]()  

This notebook contains code used for TreeMix analyses performed on the data set xxxxxxx.  
[Treemix introgression analysis notebook]()  

This notebook contains code used for D-statistic analyses performed in _pyRAD_ using the xxx.loci data set.

This notebook contains code used for fitting demographic models in _dadi__ using the xxx.loci data set.
